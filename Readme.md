Should have done better
=======================
1)From the bottom to top we can choose the index (i.e 0-8), should have implement specific row and column i.e bi directional approach.
2)Initially thought to implement Sringboot along with database and client connecting from browsers .Itâ€™s easy to maintain game session game info to store in the data base.
3)Should have implement the junit testcases
